This is a school project for a local milkbar. <br>
Some general things to watch out:
<ul>
<li>Links to other sites such as Facebook, Linkdin, Review Sites, e.t.c, will not work on Dreamweaver's live preview, as live preview does not allow this.
<li>Newer mobile browsers work perfectly, ones I've tested are Firefox Preview, and Chrome Beta/Canary.
<li>Some browsers may not support fancy features like my parallax background on my pages so just be mindful of that, from what I've tested all browsers on PC work perfectly EXCEPT FOR INTERNET EXPLORER.
</ul>
<br>
/// DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER PLEASE AS IT WILL NOT WORK VERY WELL ///
<br>
/// PLEASE OPEN THE SITE WHEN YOU HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION, AS FONTS, ICONS, AND EMBEDS (GOOGLE MAPS, FACEBOOK) WILL NOT WORK ///
<br>
/// OPEN INDEX.HTML TO START ///
