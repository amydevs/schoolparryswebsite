This is a school project for a local milkbar. <br>
Some general things to watch out:
<ul>
<li>Newer mobile browsers work perfectly, ones I've tested are Firefox Preview, and Chrome Beta/Canary.
<li>Some browsers may not support fancy features like my parallax background on my pages so just be mindful of that, from what I've tested all browsers on PC work perfectly EXCEPT FOR INTERNET EXPLORER.
</ul>
<br>
/// DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER PLEASE AS IT WILL NOT WORK VERY WELL ///
<br>
/// OPEN INDEX.HTML TO START ///
